**Our CS32 Final Project Repository!**

Welcome to our CS32 Final Project! As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes more prevalent in today's world, we realized that so many people are scared of its powers. AI is difficult to understand as so much happens behind the scenes in its programming. In order to make the process of AI more understandable and accessible, we created a simple game and had AI play it. We then combined this program with a written learning module for our product.

The lesson plan is a text walk-through accompanied by screen-recorded videos of the program running according to different parameters. At its ending, the lesson prompts the user to try game.py in their own terminal! When the student runs game.py, they can modify the meta-parameters and play around with mutation factor, population size, and number of generations.

**The learning objectives for our supposed student are as follows:**
Understand that an AI program will ‘evolve’ to solve a specific problem with repetition. 
Understand that there are different parameters that impact this evolution, so when we change these parameters, it can change how the AI evolves. 
Have an introductory familiarity with simple AI, so that it doesn’t seem as scary when interacting with it in the future!

**Our learning objectives for us as students were as follows:**
Learn how to implement AI into this game. Learn about how to make an effective lesson plan and think about which elements of our program to highlight in order to make the ideas digestible to the student. We found that learning how to teach this forces us to more comprehensively understand the forms and functions of artificial intelligence!

**Inputs for our game’s script:**
Meta-Parameters Population Size Number of Generations Mutation Factor

**What our script outputs:**
The user inputs meta parameters, and then the bots play Geometry Dash according to those parameters. 

**Important Citation Note:** We found Geometry Dash on GitHub already coded in Python by Yonah Aviv from MIT. We used Aviv's code as a base, then modified the game style a bit to better suit our purposes (his existing obstacles were a bit too big, etc), and then incorporated our AI program into the game code.
