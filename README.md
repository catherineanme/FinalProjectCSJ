**Our CS32 Final Project Repository!**


Welcome to our CS32 Final Project! As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes more prevalent in today's world, we realized that so many people are scared of, or worried about, the powers of AI because it is difficult to understand as so much happens behind the scenes in code. In order to make the process of AI more understandable and accessible, we aim to create a simple game and have AI play that game, evolving with each round played. After each round, we will print out how the computer 'learned' from the previous, and prompt the human viewer to think about how the computer might 'evolve' for the next round. This final project is a teaching tool for people who want to learn more about the basics of AI, and to help AI become more approachable.


**The learning objectives for our supposed student are as follows:**
Understand that an AI program will ‘evolve’ to solve a specific problem with repetition
Understand that there are different parameters that impact this evolution, so when we change these parameters, it can change how the AI evolves. 
Have a visual familiarity with simple AI, so that it doesn’t seem as scary when interacting with in the future! 

**Our current learning objectives for us as students are as follows:**
Learn how to implement AI into this game 
Learn about how to make an effective lesson plan and think about which elements of our program to highlight in order to make the ideas conveyed digestible to the student. We’ve found so far that learning how to teach this forces us to understand the forms and functions of artificial intelligence more comprehensively! 


**Our ‘wishlist’ for our project, and what we plan to do in the next few weeks:**

A game that the computer plays, stopping at the end of each round to display a worksheet or reflection question that helps walk the student through what is happening on-screen. In our ideal world, the final product would essentially be a learning module. In order to streamline this process, we are going to first CODE THE GAME, and then record that game being played and insert it into a simple Google-Slides online learning module that contains explanatory text.


**Inputs for our game’s script:**
Meta-Parameters
Population Size 
Number of Generations 
Mutation Factor 


**What we want our game’s script to output:** 
We want the game to be similar to the game Geometry Dash with an artificially intelligent twist: it’ll get better at the game with each round it plays. We want to be able to watch these rounds so we can screen-record them and put the videos into the learning module.
