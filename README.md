Our CS32 Final Project Repository!


Welcome to our CS32 Final Project! As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes more prevalent in today's world, we realized that so many people are scared of, or worried about, the powers of AI because it is difficult to understand as so much happens behind the scenes in code. In order to make the process of AI more understandable and accessible, we aim to create a simple game and have AI play that game, evolving with each round played. After each round, we will print out how the computer 'learned' from the previous, and prompt the human viewer to think about how the computer might 'evolve' for the next round. This final project is a teaching tool for people who want to learn more about the basics of AI, and to help AI become more approachable. 


**The Game:**

The game itself resembles 'Geometry Dash,' a basic computer game where the player has to jump over obstacles that they face. It's the same course each time. However, increased agility, faster reaction time, and most importantly repeated run-throughs of the course make a player 'better' at the game, because one knows what to expect. 

**The Evolution:**

Our AI will take the form of an evolutionary algorithm, meaning that it will start with a certain set of parameters, and then generate some number of "players" based on those parameters, each with small tweeks. These AI "players" will then play through the geometric course and afterwards, each will be graded based on a pre-determined set of critera. The most successful "player" will move on to the next iteration, with another set of "players" created through minor tweeks to the most successful one, and they will all play the game again. The other players from the previous round will be killed off. Ultimately, the player bots will get better and better after each iteration until they have optimized their performance. 

**The Human:**

We plan to use networking in order to have the human input responses to teaching prompts, and recieve the correct answer. The person will watch the game and think about how the computer got better, and then will be asked questions about what they think will happen next. We want this game to show that the basics of AI are not incredibly complicated: simply to demonstrate one way in which a computer gets better at solving problems as it completes them many times.
