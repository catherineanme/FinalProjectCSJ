Our CS32 Final Project Repository!


Welcome to our CS32 Final Project! As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes more prevalent in today's world, we realized that so many people are scared of, or worried about, the powers of AI because it is difficult to understand as so much happens behind the scenes in code. In order to make the process of AI more understandable and accessible, we aim to create a simple game and have AI play that game, evolving with each round played. After each round, we will print out how the computer 'learned' from the previous, and prompt the human viewer to think about how the computer might 'evolve' for the next round. This final project is a teaching tool for people who want to learn more about the basics of AI, and to help AI become more approachable.
